I was born and brought up in India. I moved to the United States for college in 2014 and ended up staying for close to 8 years.
I moved back to India in June 2022. These blogs document the experience, some of the pitfalls and good parts. If you are a NRI and thinking of returning back,
hopefully these will be of some use to you
